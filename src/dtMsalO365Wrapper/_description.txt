dtMsalO365Wrapper is a Python library designed to simplify authentication and interaction with Microsoft 365 services using Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and Office365-REST-Python-Client. This wrapper streamlines authentication workflows, token management, and API requests, making it easier for developers to integrate Microsoft services into their applications without dealing with the complexities of raw API calls.

This library is ideal for projects requiring seamless integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 services, such as SharePoint, Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, and more.
